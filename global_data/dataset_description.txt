We provide three csv file data sets: training inputs X_train, training outputs Y_train, and test inputs X_test.


NB: The input data X_train and X_test represent the same explanatory variables but over two different time periods.

The columns ID in X_train and Y_train are identical, and the same holds true for the testing data. 1494 rows are available for the training data sets while 654 observations are used for the test data sets.

Input data sets comprise 35 columns:

ID: Unique row identifier, associated with a day (DAY_ID) and a country (COUNTRY),

DAY_ID: Day identifier - dates have been anonymized, but all data corresponding to a specific day is consistent,

COUNTRY: Country identifier - DE = Germany, FR = France,

and then contains daily commodity price variations,

GAS_RET: European gas,

COAL_RET: European coal,

CARBON_RET: Carbon emissions futures,

weather measures (daily, in the country x),

x_TEMP: Temperature,

x_RAIN: Rainfall,

x_WIND: Wind,

energy production measures (daily, in the country x),

x_GAS: Natural gas,

x_COAL: Hard coal,

x_HYDRO: Hydro reservoir,

x_NUCLEAR: Daily nuclear production,

x_SOLAR: Photovoltaic,

x_WINDPOW: Wind power,

x_LIGNITE: Lignite,

and electricity use metrics (daily, in the country x),

x_CONSUMPTON: Total electricity consumption,

x_RESIDUAL_LOAD: Electricity consumption after using all renewable energies,

x_NET_IMPORT: Imported electricity from Europe,

x_NET_EXPORT: Exported electricity to Europe,

DE_FR_EXCHANGE: Total daily electricity exchange between Germany and France,

FR_DE_EXCHANGE: Total daily electricity exchange between France and Germany.
Output data sets are composed of two columns:

ID: Unique row identifier - corresponding to the input identifiers,

TARGET: Daily price variation for futures of 24H electricity baseload.

The solution files submitted by participants shall follow this output data set format, namely to contain two columns ID and TARGET, where the ID values correspond to those of the ID column of X_test. An example of submission file containing random predictions is provided.

Benchmark description

The benchmark for this challenge consists in a simple linear regression, after a light cleaning of the data: The missing (NaN) values are simply filled with 0's and the COUNTRY column is dropped - namely we use the same model for France and Germany.

The public score obtained with this benchmark is 15.86%.
